# Welcome to FactCheck-AI üëã

**FactCheck-AI** is an academic initiative dedicated to advancing automated Knowledge Graph (KG) fact verification through the Large Language Models (LLMs).

We are part of the [Intelligent Information Integration and Analysis (IIIA)](https://iiia.dei.unipd.it/) research group at the [Department of Information Engineering (DEI)](https://www.dei.unipd.it/) of the [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/).

## üîç What We Do

We focus on creating systems that:

- Verify factual claims by cross-referencing structured knowledge bases.
- Utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation to enhance the accuracy of fact-checking processes.
- Employ multiple LLMs to assess and validate information effectively.

## üìÇ Key Repositories

- **[FactCheck -- Benchmark](https://github.com/FactCheck-AI/FactCheck)**: Main repository for "FactCheck Benchmark" -- KG Validation via LLMs
- **[Exploration](https://github.com/FactCheck-AI/FactCheck-Exploration)**: Web-based platform enabling users to inspect every step involved in the RAG for the KG fact-checking.
- **[MockAPI](https://github.com/FactCheck-AI/FactCheck-MockAPI)**: A REST API for the FactCheck benchmark, designed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in KG fact verification. It provides all the data through the MockAPI.
