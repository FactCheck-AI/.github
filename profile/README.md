## 📂 Key Repositories

- **[FactCheck -- Benchmark](https://github.com/FactCheck-AI/FactCheck)**: Main repository for "FactCheck Benchmark" -- KG Validation via LLMs
- **[Exploration](https://github.com/FactCheck-AI/FactCheck-Exploration)**: Web-based platform enabling users to inspect every step involved in the RAG for the KG fact-checking.
- **[MockAPI](https://github.com/FactCheck-AI/FactCheck-MockAPI)**: A REST API for the FactCheck benchmark, designed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in KG fact verification. It provides all the data through the MockAPI.

## 🔍 FactCheck-AI News
- 📣 NEW! **[Dataset-wise Analysis](https://github.com/FactCheck-AI/FactCheck/blob/main/extra-experiments/dataset-wise/README.md)** are now available as Extra Experiments.
- 📣 NEW! **[MockAPI](https://factcheck-api.dei.unipd.it/)** is now available through unipd servers.

## 🔍 What We Do

We focus on creating systems that:

- Verify factual claims by cross-referencing structured knowledge bases.
- Utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation to enhance the accuracy of fact-checking processes.
- Employ multiple LLMs to assess and validate information effectively.
